# Course Philosophy

PSYC 7750G was designed around a simple premise: reproducibility is not an advanced skill — it is a foundational habit.

Rather than treating R as a software tool to learn in isolation, this course approaches R as a complete research environment. Students learn how to move from raw data to interpretable results using transparent, inspectable, and repeatable workflows.

The emphasis is not merely on running statistical tests. The emphasis is on building analytical systems that others can understand, rerun, and verify.

By the end of the semester, students do not just complete assignments — they produce a cohesive analytical portfolio.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students are able to:

-   Write and execute R scripts for applied data analysis\
-   Clean and wrangle datasets using reproducible workflows\
-   Create publication-quality visualizations using `ggplot2`\
-   Conduct and interpret common statistical analyses (t-tests, ANOVA, regression, logistic regression, Chi-Square)\
-   Reproduce analyses from published psychology papers with open datasets\
-   Communicate results in structured Quarto documents\
-   Apply open science practices (e.g., OSF, GitHub, transparent documentation)\
-   Assemble individual analyses into a polished Quarto book

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Course Structure

The course follows a consistent weekly rhythm designed to reinforce applied learning.

## Tuesdays — Concept + Guided Implementation

-   Short conceptual lecture (20–25 minutes)
-   Live coding demonstration
-   Guided mini-lab exercises
-   Emphasis on understanding the logic behind each method

## Thursdays — Applied Workshop

-   Hands-on work with real datasets
-   Reproduction of analyses from published psychology papers
-   Debugging as a collaborative process
-   Screen-sharing and peer problem solving encouraged

This structure ensures that students immediately apply conceptual material in authentic research contexts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assessment Design

Evaluation in this course is cumulative and portfolio-driven.

## Weekly Assignments (40%)

Each week introduces a new methodological framework. Assignments require students to:

-   Clean and analyze real datasets
-   Interpret statistical output
-   Produce reproducible visualizations
-   Write structured narrative explanations

Assignments progressively increase in complexity.

## Midterm Project (30%)

The midterm integrates:

-   Data import and merging\
-   Variable engineering\
-   t-tests and ANOVA\
-   Post-hoc comparisons\
-   Evidence-based recommendation

Students demonstrate their ability to conduct a complete inferential workflow independently.

## Final Project (30%)

Students design and conduct an original research project using NYC Open Data or other civic datasets.

The final submission includes:

-   Fully reproducible analysis\
-   Clear research framing\
-   Professional visualizations\
-   Public-facing interpretation\
-   In-class presentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Conceptual Arc of the Semester

The course progresses through four major phases:

## Foundations

-   R basics
-   Data structures
-   Functions and packages
-   Tidyverse workflows

## Visualization & Exploration

-   `ggplot2`
-   Feature engineering
-   Exploratory data analysis
-   Data cleaning decisions

## Statistical Inference

-   t-tests\
-   ANOVA\
-   Correlation\
-   Linear regression\
-   Chi-Square tests\
-   Logistic regression

## Reproducible Communication

-   Quarto documents\
-   Structured reporting\
-   Transparent code practices\
-   Building a Quarto book

Each stage builds directly on the previous one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Open Science Integration

Reproducibility is treated as a default expectation.

Students are required to:

-   Load data programmatically\
-   Avoid manual spreadsheet edits\
-   Document all cleaning decisions\
-   Avoid hard-coding statistical results\
-   Use structured document formats\
-   Present analyses transparently

Open science practices such as preregistration, OSF usage, and GitHub version control are introduced and encouraged throughout the semester.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# From Coursework to Authorship

The final assignment requires students to assemble all assignments and projects into a cohesive Quarto book.

This transforms:

-   Discrete homework submissions\
    into\
-   A structured analytical portfolio

The result is a professional artifact suitable for:

-   Graduate school applications\
-   Research lab submissions\
-   Industry analytics portfolios\
-   Conference presentations\
-   Public-facing civic research

Students leave the course not only having learned R, but having built a body of reproducible work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Institutional Policies & Resources

The course follows all Brooklyn College and CUNY policies regarding academic integrity, accessibility services, and student support resources.

Students are expected to adhere to the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and to utilize campus support services when needed.

For official policy details, students should refer to the Brooklyn College website and Undergraduate Bulletin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Closing Note

Reproducible research is not about perfection.

It is about clarity.\
It is about transparency.\
It is about building analytical habits that scale beyond a single course.

This blueprint reflects a semester-long progression from foundational skills to independent analytical authorship.
