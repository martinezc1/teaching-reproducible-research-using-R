# Overview {#sec-one}

This assignment introduces core concepts in base R, including arithmetic operations, object assignment, vectors, data frames, and built-in datasets. The goal is to build comfort with fundamental R syntax before moving into more advanced workflows.

You will complete all tasks in a single `.R` script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

-   Perform arithmetic operations in R
-   Assign results to objects using `<-`
-   Create and manipulate vectors
-   Construct and subset data frames
-   Explore built-in datasets
-   Produce a simple base R visualization
-   Organize a script using clear comments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Textbook Connection

This assignment builds directly from **Chapter 1: Introduction to R** in [Reproducible Research Using R](https://martinezc1-reproducible-research-using-r.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

Students are encouraged to review the chapter before beginning this assignment, as it provides the conceptual foundation and reproducible workflow demonstrated here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Submission Instructions

Submit **one `.R` script file**.

Your script must:

-   Be clearly organized into labeled sections\
    *(e.g., `# Part 1: R as a Calculator`)*
-   Include all required calculations and outputs
-   Include your reflection as comments at the end
-   Run from top to bottom without errors

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment Tasks

## Part 1: R as a Calculator

1.  Calculate `12 * 2`.
2.  Calculate the square root of `144`.
3.  Calculate `100 / 7` and round to **2 decimals**.
4.  Save the result of `15 * 4` as `my_product`.
5.  Save `100 / 7`, rounded to **5 decimals**, as `my_second_product`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 2: Vectors

1.  Create a numeric vector of five random numbers named `randy`.
2.  Compute the mean, median, minimum, and maximum of `randy`.
3.  Create another numeric vector of five random numbers named `randy2`.
4.  Create `randy_combined` by adding `randy` and `randy2`.
5.  Create a character vector of five favorite movies.
6.  Use indexing to print the fourth movie.
7.  Create a factor with 11 entries of favorite foods (repeat some).
8.  Use `table()` to count frequencies.
9.  Sort the table in descending order and save as `organized_table`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 3: Data Frames

1.  Create a data frame called `class_df` with columns:
    -   name\
    -   age\
    -   major
2.  Add at least four fictional classmates.
3.  Create `age_in_2009`.
4.  Create `favorite_professor`.
5.  Use indexing to:
    -   Select only name and major.
    -   Filter rows for Psych majors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part 4: Built-in Datasets

Using `mtcars`:

1.  Display the first 11 rows.
2.  List all column names.
3.  Run `str(mtcars)` and describe column types in a comment.
4.  Run `summary(mtcars)`.
5.  Create a base R scatterplot titled:

> "My First Scatterplot"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reflection

At the end of your script, answer in 2–3 sentences (as comments):

What was the most surprising or confusing thing you learned about R so far?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reproducibility Practice (Assignment 1)

For this first assignment, focus on script organization and documentation.

At the top of your script, include a structured comment block containing:

-   Assignment name\
-   Your name\
-   Date\
-   A brief description of what the script accomplishes

Your script should:

-   Be divided into clearly labeled sections
-   Run from top to bottom without manual intervention
-   Avoid unnecessary objects

This assignment establishes your baseline reproducibility habits for the semester.
