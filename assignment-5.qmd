title: "Assignment 5: R Script → Quarto Report"
subtitle: "From analysis script to a reproducible, published HTML report"
---

# Overview {#sec-five}

This week, you will take your Week 3 homework assignment (NYPD Shooting Incidents) and convert it into a **Quarto** report (`.qmd`). Using the same prompt and the work you already completed, your task is to create a fully reproducible, publishable HTML report.

Your final output should read like a short research note: code + narrative explanations + tables/plots + brief interpretation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

-   Convert an analysis workflow from an R script into a reproducible Quarto document
-   Organize work into labeled code chunks that render cleanly to HTML
-   Combine narrative text with analysis code to communicate findings
-   Use inline R expressions to report values dynamically
-   Create publication-quality tables and visualizations for the web
-   Publish a reproducible report and share it via a link

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Textbook Connection

This assignment builds directly from **Chapter 10: Reproducible Reporting** in [Reproducible Research Using R](https://martinezc1-reproducible-research-using-r.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

Students are encouraged to review the chapter before beginning this assignment, as it provides the conceptual foundation and reproducible workflow demonstrated here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Submission Instructions

Submit **two things**:

1.  A link to your published HTML report (e.g., RPubs, Posit Connect/Cloud, GitHub Pages, etc.)
2.  Your `.qmd` file

**Your Quarto report must render to HTML without errors.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment Tasks

Your Quarto document must include the following sections and components.

## 1. YAML header

Include:

-   Title
-   Your name as the *author*

## 2. Setup chunk

Load all required libraries (for example: `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`, `nycOpenData`, etc.).

## 3. Minimum required code chunks (4)

Your report must contain *at least* the following four code chunks:

1.  **Data ingest**\
    Use `nycOpenData::nyc_shooting_incidents()` to load the NYPD shootings dataset.

2.  **Data cleaning**\
    At least **two** cleaning/feature steps (examples: dropping NAs, creating `time_of_day`, lowercasing a column, creating `days_since`).

3.  **Insights**\
    Include the code used to generate your Week 3 insights (grouped summaries, counts, etc.).

4.  **Tables & Graphs**

    -   At least **one table** created with `knitr::kable()`
    -   At least **two ggplot2 graphs**:
        -   one related to `time_of_day`
        -   one supporting your personal insight

*All tables and graphs must have captions!*

## 4. Narrative text

After **each** code chunk, write a short explanation describing:

-   what you did
-   why you did it
-   what you learned or produced

## 5. Inline R expression

Include at least **one** inline R expression in your narrative text.

Example:

> The dataset contains `r nrow(shooting_data)` rows after cleaning.

## 6. Hyperlink to the dataset

Provide a clickable link to the dataset (not a raw URL pasted as plain text).

Example:

[NYC Open Data Portal — NYPD Shooting Incident Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/)

*(You may link directly to the dataset page if you prefer.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reflection

In **3–5 sentences**, explain how this workflow could potentially help you in your thesis research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Publishing Instructions

1.  Render your Quarto document to HTML.
2.  Publish it online (e.g., RPubs).
3.  Submit:
    -   the link to the published HTML
    -   your `.qmd` file

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reproducibility Practice (Quarto Reporting)

This assignment focuses on reproducibility as **communication**.

In your report:

-   Chunk labels should be meaningful (e.g., `data-ingest`, `cleaning`, `insights`, `plots`)
-   Your narrative should match your code (a reader should understand what each chunk accomplishes)
-   Inline R values should be used to avoid hard-coding numbers that may change if the dataset updates
-   Your HTML output should render cleanly and be readable without needing the original script

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Publishing Instructions

1.  Render your `.qmd` file to HTML.
2.  Confirm that warnings and messages do not appear in the final document.
3.  Submit both your `.qmd` file and your published `.html` report.
