title: "Assignment 10: Wage Analytics — Predicting High vs Low Earners Using Logistic Regression"
subtitle: "Binary Classification • Logistic Regression • Model Evaluation • ROC/AUC"
---

# Overview {#sec-ten}

The **Wage Analytics Division (WAD)** has hired you as their new **Data Scientist**.

Your mission is to determine whether demographic and employment characteristics can be used to **predict whether a worker earns a high or low wage**.

Using the `Wage` dataset from the `ISLR` package, you will:

-   Create a binary wage classification
-   Explore relationships between predictors and wage
-   Build a logistic regression model
-   Evaluate predictive performance on unseen data

Your analysis will help the company understand which characteristics are associated with higher earnings and determine how well a predictive model performs in practice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

-   Clean and prepare mixed-type real-world data
-   Create a binary outcome variable
-   Conduct t-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests
-   Perform a train/test split
-   Build and interpret a logistic regression model
-   Evaluate classifier performance using confusion matrices and ROC/AUC
-   Communicate predictive modeling results clearly and professionally

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Textbook Connection

This assignment builds directly from **Chapter 9: Logistic Regression** in [Reproducible Research Using R](https://martinezc1-reproducible-research-using-r.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

Students are encouraged to review the chapter before beginning this assignment, as it provides the conceptual foundation and reproducible workflow demonstrated here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Submission Instructions

Submit **two files**:

1.  Your `.qmd` file\
2.  Your knitted and published `.html` file

Your document must:

-   Knit without errors
-   Suppress warnings and messages in the final HTML
-   Include clearly labeled sections
-   Include all statistical tests and model outputs
-   Include performance metrics and ROC curve
-   Include a professional final summary
-   Use at least one inline R expression

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment Tasks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Create the WageCategory Variable

Begin by preparing the dataset.

### Required Tasks

-   Load the `Wage` dataset from the `ISLR` package

-   Create a new factor variable called `WageCategory`:

    -   If `wage > median(wage)` → `"High"`
    -   If `wage < median(wage)` → `"Low"`

-   Convert `WageCategory` into a factor variable

### Important

-   You must **NOT remove** `wage` or `logwage`
-   Be prepared to explain the concept of **target leakage** and why it matters in predictive modeling

Briefly explain why creating a binary outcome transforms this into a classification problem.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Data Cleaning

Some categorical variables in the `Wage` dataset contain numeric prefixes (e.g., `"3. Asian"`).

### Required Tasks

-   Remove numeric prefixes from all relevant categorical variables
-   Ensure categorical variables are clean and properly formatted before analysis

Provide a brief explanation of why cleaning categorical labels is important for interpretation and modeling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Classical Statistical Tests

You will explore relationships between predictors and wage using classical inference methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A. t-test

Compare **age** between High and Low wage earners.

Your write-up must include:

-   Mean age for each wage group
-   t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value
-   A short interpretation of whether age differs between wage categories

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### B. ANOVA

Using the original numeric `wage` variable, choose **one** of the following:

-   `wage ~ education`
-   `wage ~ maritl`
-   `wage ~ jobclass`

Your write-up must include:

-   ANOVA table
-   F-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value
-   A brief interpretation of the result

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### C. Chi-Square Test

Choose **one categorical relationship** that is different from your ANOVA variable.

You must:

-   Create a contingency table
-   Conduct a Chi-Square test
-   Report χ², df, and p-value
-   Compute and interpret Cramer’s V
-   Describe any patterns observed in the contingency table

Explain what the Chi-Square test tells you about association.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Logistic Regression Model

You will now build a predictive model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Train/Test Split

-   Perform a 70/30 split using `sample.split()`
-   Clearly define your training and testing datasets

Explain why separating training and test data is critical in predictive modeling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model Specification

-   Build a logistic regression model predicting `WageCategory`
-   Choose predictors thoughtfully (be cautious of leakage or redundancy)

Your write-up must include:

-   Logistic regression output

-   Odds ratios using `exp(coef())`

-   A 2–4 sentence interpretation describing:

    -   Which predictors are significant
    -   Direction of effects
    -   Magnitude of effects
    -   Any surprising findings

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Model Evaluation on Test Data

Using your **test dataset**, compute:

-   Predicted probabilities
-   Predicted classes ("High" or "Low")
-   Confusion matrix

Report and interpret:

-   Accuracy
-   Sensitivity
-   Specificity
-   Balanced Accuracy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ROC Curve and AUC

-   Generate an ROC curve
-   Compute AUC

In your interpretation, discuss:

-   How well the model identifies high earners
-   How accuracy compares to the No Information Rate
-   Whether the model performs better than guessing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Final Interpretation

Write a professional 3–5 paragraph summary addressing:

-   Whether age, education, jobclass, or marital status meaningfully relate to wage
-   Which predictors were most influential in the logistic regression
-   How well the model performed on unseen data
-   Which wage group the model predicts best
-   What variables you would add or remove if repeating the analysis
-   One limitation of your modeling approach

Your tone should resemble a professional data science report, not a homework answer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Guidelines for Interpretation

When interpreting regression results, include:

-   Direction (positive or negative relationship)
-   Magnitude (odds ratio interpretation)
-   Statistical significance
-   Plain-language meaning

Example:

> Workers with higher education levels have greater odds of being classified as high earners, holding other factors constant.

Avoid technical jargon without explanation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reflection

In 4–6 sentences, answer:

1.  What is the difference between inference and prediction?
2.  Why is target leakage dangerous in predictive modeling?
3.  What did you learn about evaluating classifier performance?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reproducibility Practice

This assignment emphasizes responsible predictive modeling.

Your document must:

-   Load data programmatically
-   Clean variables reproducibly
-   Use clearly labeled code chunks
-   Avoid hard-coding values in narrative
-   Use inline R expressions where appropriate
-   Suppress warnings and messages in the final HTML
-   Render cleanly without manual edits

The goal is that another analyst could reproduce your entire workflow and validate every statistical claim.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
