# Overview {#sec-eight}

The **Florida Police Department (FPD)** has hired you as their new **Data Analyst**. Your mission is to uncover which socioeconomic factors are most strongly associated with rising crime rates across Florida counties.

Using county-level data, you will conduct a **fully reproducible Quarto analysis** to determine whether **income, education, or urbanization** best explain differences in crime rates.

Your findings will help inform statewide prevention strategies, resource allocation, and community outreach efforts.

This assignment assesses your ability to:

-   Clean and prepare structured data
-   Compute and interpret correlations
-   Build and compare regression models
-   Evaluate model fit using R² and AIC
-   Communicate statistical findings to a non-technical executive audience

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

-   Clean and standardize real-world datasets
-   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-   Interpret correlation matrices
-   Build simple and multiple regression models
-   Compare models using R², Adjusted R², and AIC
-   Explain regression results in plain language
-   Produce a reproducible Quarto report suitable for executive review

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Textbook Connection

This assignment builds directly from **Chapter 8: Linear Regression** in [Reproducible Research Using R](https://martinezc1-reproducible-research-using-r.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

Students are encouraged to review the chapter before beginning this assignment, as it provides the conceptual foundation and reproducible workflow demonstrated here.

# Submission Instructions

Submit **two files**:

1.  Your `.qmd` file\
2.  Your knitted and published `.html` file

Your document must:

-   Knit without errors
-   Suppress warnings and messages in the final HTML
-   Include clearly labeled sections
-   Include all required visualizations
-   Include regression tables and model comparisons
-   Include a professional memo to the Chief of the FPD
-   Use at least one inline R expression

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Assignment Tasks

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Data Loading and Preparation

You have been provided with an Excel file containing the following columns:

| Column | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| County | County name                      |
| C      | Crime rate (per 1,000 residents) |
| I      | Median income (in thousands)     |
| HS     | High-school graduation rate (%)  |
| U      | Urban population (%)             |

### Required Tasks

You must:

-   Load the dataset reproducibly

-   Rename the columns to:

    -   `Crime`
    -   `Income`
    -   `HighSchoolGrad`
    -   `UrbanPop`

-   Format all county names so that only the first letter is capitalized

-   Inspect the dataset structure

-   Provide summary statistics

Include a brief explanation of why consistent naming and formatting are essential for reproducible modeling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

### Required Components

-   Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, range) for all numeric variables
-   Create at least **two visualizations** (e.g., histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)
-   Provide written interpretation of what you observe

Your interpretation should address:

-   Distribution shapes
-   Potential outliers
-   Initial patterns between predictors and crime

### Bonus (Optional)

Using `ggplot2` and mapping tools, create a heatmap of Florida counties based on crime rates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Correlation Analysis

Investigate which factors are most strongly associated with crime.

### Required Tasks

-   Compute a correlation matrix including:

    -   Crime
    -   Income
    -   HighSchoolGrad
    -   UrbanPop

-   Identify which predictor shows the strongest relationship with Crime

-   Interpret the direction (positive or negative)

-   Interpret the strength (weak, moderate, strong)

(Optional) Visualize the correlation matrix using a correlation plotting tool.

In your written interpretation, explain:

-   Which factor appears most important
-   Whether any predictors appear highly correlated with one another
-   Why correlation does not imply causation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Building Regression Models

You will now build models to predict county-level crime rates.

### Required Models

1.  A **simple regression model** using the predictor you believe fits best

2.  At least **two multiple regression models**, such as:

    -   Income + HighSchoolGrad\
    -   Income + UrbanPop\
    -   A full model with all predictors

3.  (Optional) Include an interaction term if theoretically justified

### Model Comparison

Compare models using:

-   R²
-   Adjusted R²
-   AIC

Interpret:

-   Which predictors are statistically significant
-   Which model explains the most variance
-   Which model best balances simplicity and explanatory power

Explain why Adjusted R² and AIC are useful when comparing multiple models.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Executive Memo to the Chief of the Florida Police Department

Write a short professional memo addressed to:

**Chief\
Florida Police Department**

Your memo must include:

-   The best-performing model
-   The most influential predictor(s)
-   The proportion of variance explained (R²)
-   Clear, plain-language interpretation
-   One limitation of your analysis
-   One actionable recommendation for resource allocation or prevention strategy

Your tone should be executive-level and professional.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Guidelines for Interpretation

When discussing results, always include:

-   **Direction** — Positive or negative relationship\
-   **Strength** — Weak, moderate, or strong\
-   **Significance** — Statistically significant or not\
-   **Plain language meaning**

Example:

> Counties with lower median income tend to have higher crime rates. For every \$1,000 increase in median income, predicted crime decreases while holding other factors constant.

Avoid technical jargon without explanation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Question

At the end of your report, include a short written response to:

> Based on your analysis, which model best predicts Florida’s county-level crime rates, and why?

Be specific and reference your model comparison metrics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reflection

In 4–6 sentences, answer:

1.  Why is reproducibility especially important when working with public policy data?
2.  What did you learn about the difference between correlation and regression?
3.  How does model comparison improve decision-making?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reproducibility Practice

This assignment emphasizes reproducible modeling and executive communication.

Your document must:

-   Load data programmatically
-   Avoid manual data manipulation outside the script
-   Use clearly labeled code chunks
-   Avoid hard-coding results in narrative
-   Use inline R expressions where appropriate
-   Suppress warnings/messages in the final published HTML

The goal is that another analyst could rerun your analysis and verify every claim.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Publishing Instructions

1.  Render your `.qmd` file to HTML.
2.  Confirm that warnings and messages do not appear in the final document.
3.  Submit both your `.qmd` file and your published `.html` report.
