# Overview {#sec-book}

Your final assignment is to transform all of your completed course work into a polished, cohesive **Quarto book**.

Throughout the semester, every assignment was written in Quarto format for a reason. Now, you will combine them into a single published book.

You will:

- Convert your assignments into a structured Quarto book project  
- Organize them into chapters  
- Polish formatting and presentation  
- Publish your completed book  

This book will serve as a **professional portfolio artifact** that you can share with:

- Potential employers  
- Graduate programs  
- Research labs  
- Collaborators  
- Friends and family  

By completing this assignment, you are not just submitting coursework —

You are officially becoming an author.

## 5. Chapter Introductions

Each chapter must begin with a short introduction explaining:

- The purpose of the assignment  
- The skills or methods used

## 6. Figure and Table Captions

Every figure, plot, and table must include:

- A clear, descriptive caption  
- An explanation of what the reader is viewing

There should be no unlabeled figures in your book.

## 7. Final Reflection Chapter

Your final chapter must be a reflective essay (minimum 400 words) addressing:

- What you learned this semester
