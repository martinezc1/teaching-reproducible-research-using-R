subtitle: "Independent Civic Research • Reproducible Workflow • Public-Facing Communication"

# Overview {#sec-final}

Your final project for this course is to design and conduct an **original research project** using NYC Open Data.

Your project will be written as a fully reproducible **Quarto document** and structured as though it were ready for public presentation at **NYC Open Data Week**.

This assignment is designed to:

- Give you experience designing an independent research project  
- Provide hands-on work with open civic datasets  
- Produce a polished portfolio-ready artifact  
- Strengthen your reproducible workflow and data communication skills  
- Prepare you to submit to NYC Open Data Week 2026 if you choose  

By the end of this course, you will have created a professional-quality research document suitable for public presentation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Formulate a clear, data-driven research question
- Identify and justify appropriate open datasets
- Build a fully reproducible data workflow
- Clean, wrangle, and analyze civic data responsibly
- Create clear and meaningful visualizations
- Write for a public-facing, non-technical audience
- Connect your work to broader open data principles

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Textbook Connection

This final project synthesizes concepts in [Reproducible Research Using R](https://martinezc1-reproducible-research-using-r.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

Students are encouraged to review the chapter before beginning this assignment, as it provides the conceptual foundation and reproducible workflow demonstrated here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project Requirements

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Dataset Selection

You must:

- Select **at least one dataset** from the NYC Open Data Portal (preferred).
- Other publicly available civic datasets regarding NYC are acceptable **with instructor approval**.
- Clearly cite and hyperlink all datasets used.
- Justify why the dataset is appropriate for your research question.

Your project should demonstrate thoughtful dataset selection rather than convenience-based selection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Reproducible Analysis (Quarto)

Your final submission must:

- Be written in **Quarto (.qmd)** format.
- Include narrative, code, output, and interpretation in one document.
- Knit/render successfully without errors.
- Suppress unnecessary warnings and messages in the final output.

Your workflow should clearly demonstrate:

- Data import  
- Cleaning and transformation  
- Analysis aligned with your research question  
- Transparent decision-making  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Proposal-Style Structure

Your document should be structured as if it were an Open Data Week proposal.

Include the following sections:

### A. Title & Event Description

- A clear, compelling project title.
- A 1–2 paragraph overview explaining:
  - Your research question
  - Why it matters
  - What attendees would learn

Write this as though it were submitted to Open Data Week.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### B. Dataset(s) Used

- Describe the dataset(s).
- Provide proper citations and links.
- Explain how the dataset(s) connect to your research question.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### C. Analysis

- Present a reproducible workflow from raw data to results.
- Clearly explain:
  - What you cleaned and why
  - What transformations were performed
  - What analyses were conducted
- Align every analysis step with your research question.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### D. Visualizations

Include **at least two** clear, well-labeled figures or tables created in R.

All visualizations must:

- Include titles
- Include axis labels
- Include captions
- Be readable in a public-facing setting

Explain what each visualization shows and why it matters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### E. Audience & Relevance

Identify:

- Who would care about this project?
  - New Yorkers?
  - Policymakers?
  - Journalists?
  - Community organizations?
- Why does this research matter in a civic context?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### F. Connection to Open Data

Explain how your project:

- Demonstrates transparency
- Highlights accessibility of public data
- Shows the value of open civic information
- Reflects open data principles

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Length & Formatting Requirements

- Minimum **500 words of written narrative** (excluding code).
- Figures and tables must be clearly labeled.
- Citations must be properly formatted.
- The document must render cleanly to HTML or PDF.

Submit both:

- Your `.qmd` file  
- Your knitted HTML or PDF output  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Class Presentation

You will present your project during the final weeks of the semester.

Presentation Requirements:

- 10–12 minutes
- 2–3 minutes for Q&A
- Use slides (Quarto, PowerPoint, etc.)

Your presentation should:

- Clearly explain your research question
- Highlight key findings
- Show at least one visualization
- Be understandable to a non-technical audience

This is practice for a potential Open Data Week 2026 submission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Class Publication (Optional but Encouraged)

At the end of the semester, projects may be compiled into a collective class book via Posit Cloud.

Each student’s project may appear as a chapter.

Benefits:

- A publication credit
- A portfolio artifact
- A public-facing research contribution

You may opt out if you prefer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Grading (100 Points Total)

- Dataset & Research Question (15 pts)  
  Clarity, appropriateness, creativity  

- Reproducibility (20 pts)  
  Working document, organized workflow, transparent code  

- Analysis (20 pts)  
  Depth, correctness, alignment with question  

- Visualizations (10 pts)  
  Clarity, design, relevance  

- Public Framing & Civic Relevance (10 pts)  
  Event description, audience, connection to Open Data  

- Class Presentation (15 pts)  
  Clarity, engagement, professionalism  

- Professionalism & Formatting (10 pts)  
  Writing quality, citations, organization  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reproducibility Practice

This final project emphasizes transparent and repeatable workflows.

Your document must:

- Load all required packages explicitly  
- Import data programmatically  
- Avoid manual editing of datasets  
- Clearly document cleaning decisions  
- Avoid hard-coding results in interpretation  
- Render cleanly without errors  
- Set a seed if using sampling, modeling, or randomness

The goal is that another analyst could reproduce your findings exactly.
